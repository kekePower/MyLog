**Plans or hopes for the future**

I'd like to extend the script so that it'll work in a department.
Thinking that it'll log based on the current user and with a global log-file,
placed on a global share.

Perhaps create a way to create reports that will be emailed to a set of defined users.
The report will be based on dates or a user and can be run as a cron-job.

Let me know what you'd like to see this script do and I'll try.
